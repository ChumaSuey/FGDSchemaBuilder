# FGD Schema Builder

(Personal text from main programmer Chuma)
FGD Schema Builder is a React script i've made not so long ago, the idea started via a suggestion of my friend Lavender, then i proceeded to sit down the code to experiment and at least do some automation on the editing of FGD files for the level editor Trenchbroom, associated with Quake family branch games and possibly Godot... i've got help from a lot of friends and people from the Quake community, this project was not easy... i was happy with doing this and attempting to make an automation script even for experimental purposes, even if it's not optimal, hope you enjoy this documentation, thank you in advance)

Proceeding now with the formal talk of the project.

The app will be referred as SB for simplification.

## Technical Aspects / Technical Content

The script is made out of React (Javascript language), there are some remnants in some branches of Python (possibly this one) but it doesn't work, what Python initially in backend was the parsing and file handling.


# Instructions on how to use the Website.

It's very recommended the user uses an FGD file as an skeletal reference or template... There are some notes to point out from the script that are going to be appointed.

Also it's very recommended to partially edit the file manually in certain parts or corrections, the website

When entering the website, the next picture show as follows.

Colors were used to segment and classify all the functionality better.

There are 3 columns : 
- Left(Orange) : Shows the entity list of the fgd file, it also has a search bar and a filter by entity.
- Center(Yellow) : Shows the properties of the selected entity.
- Right(Red) : Is a live viewer of the FGD file as seen in UTF-8 or a close approximation of it.
There's one upper side to the website, in a short description fashion:
- Up(Green) : Are the buttons "property" buttons of the website.

As stated before the workflow is to edit an already existing FGD file, while the user can start from scratch, and that's technically possible, focus is going to be on the main workflow functionality.

The website internally stores the FGD file information unless exported.
