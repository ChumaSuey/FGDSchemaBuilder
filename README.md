# FGD Schema Builder

(Personal text from main programmer Chuma)
FGD Schema Builder is a React script i've made not so long ago, the idea started via a suggestion of my friend Lavender, then i proceeded to sit down the code to experiment and at least do some automation on the editing of FGD files for the level editor Trenchbroom, associated with Quake family branch games and possibly Godot.

Proceeding now with the formal talk of the project.
